## Introduction

This repository provides the code and resources associated with our paper titled **Text with Knowledge Graph Augmented Transformer for Video Captioning**, which has been accepted by CVPR 2023. The paper presents a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs to deal with the the challenge of long-tail words in video captioning tasks.
